#  100 Days of C — Challenge by me :]

> "Discipline turns beginners into masters — one line of C at a time."

##  The Mission
I’m challenging myself to **code every single day** in C for **100 days**.  
No excuses. No skipping. Just pure consistency and learning.  

This journey is about:
- Building a strong foundation in **C programming**
- Understanding how computers think  
- Learning how to solve problems from scratch  
- Becoming **a better engineer** — day by day 

---

##  Challenge Rules
1. Code **at least 1 hour** every day.
2. Push my code to GitHub daily 
3. Write clean, commented, and readable code 
4. Document what I learned each day 
5. Never give up, even when it gets tough 

##  Motivation
> “You don’t have to be great to start,  
> but you have to start to be great.”  

---

##  Final Goal
At the end of these 100 days,  
I want to be confident enough to **build real C projects**,  
and say proudly:  
> *“I mastered the fundamentals.”*
