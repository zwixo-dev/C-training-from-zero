No excuses. No skipping. Just pure consistency and learning.  

This journey is about:
- Building a strong foundation in **C programming**
- Understanding how computers think 🧩  
- Learning how to solve problems from scratch 💡  
- Becoming **a better engineer** — day by day ⚙️

## 🗓️ Challenge Rules
1. Code **at least 1 hour** every day.
2. Push my code to GitHub daily 📤
3. Write clean, commented, and readable code ✍️
4. Document what I learned each day 🧾
5. Never give up, even when it gets tough 💪

## 💬 Motivation

## 🧠 Final Goal
At the end of these 100 days,
